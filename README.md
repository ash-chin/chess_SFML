# chess_SFML
Writing the very basics of chess in C++ using SFML. I don't actually plan on building out a full chess game, or even necessarily implementing all the rules. I'm more so trying to become more familiar with C++ and build a foundation that I can use for a basic, 2D tactics prototype down the road.
